## Description

This repo is to implement the method in this paper [Optimizing Millions of Hyperparameters by Implicit Differentiation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02590).

The authors' implementation can be found at this [link](https://github.com/lorraine2/implicit-hyper-opt).

The motivation to reimplement is to 
1. serve my own learning purpose
2. have a cleaner source code
3. compare several approaches related to inverse Hessian vector product
